# github-api-bulk-transfer

A utility for transferring multiple GitHub Classroom repositories to a new owner (user or organization).

This tool was derived from [jdbean/github-api-bulk-transfer](https://github.com/jdbean/github-api-bulk-transfer),
but has a slightly different behaviour:

- It combines repo names with contributors in the GitHub classroom format (`prefix-username`).
- It deletes the student from the original collaborators.
  This is to avoid outside collaborator limits and ok for archival purposes.
- It formats the output more nicely.
